# Madison Metro Bus Stop Optimizer
### The Madison Metro Bus Stop Tracker is a Java-based program designed to provide users with the most accurate and up-to-date information about bus arrivals at specific stops within the Madison, Wisconsin area. Instead of relying on conventional methods like Google Maps, this project leverages the power of the Madison Metro bus system's API to fetch both schedule and live bus data for different routes.

## Project Overview
### The core objective of this project is to develop a program that utilizes the schedule data obtained from the Metro API to inform users about the upcoming buses at a specific stop. The underlying data structure employed for this purpose is a BST, or Binary Search Tree. A BST provides an efficient way to organize and search for information, allowing users to quickly identify the bus with the shortest arrival time at a given stop.
## Key Features
### Live Bus Updates through Madison Metro API
### Manual BST Implementation
